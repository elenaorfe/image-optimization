# image-optimization
This repository contains a utility script that helps developers calculate the optimal value for the `sizes attribute of the HTML `<img>` element.

The sizes attribute plays a crucial role in responsive image loading, allowing the browser to choose the most appropriate image source from a srcset. However, calculating the correct value can be complex, especially in dynamic layouts. This script simplifies that process by outputting the proper sizes string to use.
